In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is defined as **a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations**. This practical method is often used in calculations, data processing, and automatic reasoning because it contains **clear and concise instructions** and can be executed in **limited time and space complexities**.
