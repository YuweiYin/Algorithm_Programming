**Dynamic programming** is both a **mathematical optimization method** and a **computer programming method**. In both contexts it refers to **simplifying** a complicated problem by **breaking it down into simpler sub-problems** in a **recursive** manner. While some decision problems cannot be taken apart this way, decisions that span several points in time do often break apart recursively.
