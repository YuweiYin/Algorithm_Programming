In computer science, a data structure is **a way to store and organize data**.

During the computer programming process, **identifying and using the appropriate data structure** is an important task as it can **improve the overall efficiency** of the algorithm. In large-scale systems, **choosing the most suitable data structure** directly impacts the difficulty of program design and the final quality and performance.
